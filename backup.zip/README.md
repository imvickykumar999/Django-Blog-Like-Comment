# `Solving PermissionError`

    PermissionError at /admin/blog/post/add/
    [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/blog2.webp'

---

The `PermissionError` indicates that Django does not have the necessary permissions to write to the specified directory or file. This error occurs when trying to upload a file, in this case, `blog2.webp`, to the `/home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/` directory.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the directory has the correct permissions and ownership to allow Django to write files to it. Here are steps you can take:

1. **Check Directory Permissions**:

   Ensure that the directory `/home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/` has the appropriate write permissions.

   ```sh
   ls -ld /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```sh
   drwxr-xr-x 2 yourusername yourgroup 4096 Jul 30 12:34 /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

   The `drwxr-xr-x` indicates the permissions. The first `d` means it's a directory, and the following characters show the permissions for the owner, group, and others.

2. **Change Permissions**:

   If the directory does not have write permissions for the user running Django, you can change the permissions. For example, to give write permissions to the owner and group:

   ```sh
   chmod 775 /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

3. **Check Directory Ownership**:

   Ensure that the directory is owned by the user running the Django application (usually the user under which the web server runs, e.g., `www-data` for Apache or Nginx).

   ```sh
   chown yourusername:yourgroup /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` and `yourgroup` with the appropriate values.

4. **Recursive Permission and Ownership Change**:

   If you need to apply these changes recursively to ensure all subdirectories and files have the correct permissions and ownership, you can use the `-R` flag:

   ```sh
   chmod -R 775 /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   chown -R yourusername:yourgroup /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

5. **SELinux Contexts (If Applicable)**:

   If you are using SELinux, you might also need to set the correct SELinux context for the directory:

   ```sh
   chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /home/VicksBlogLikeComment/blogproject/media/blog_images/
   ```

After applying these changes, try uploading the file again. If the problem persists, double-check that the web server or application server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) is running under the correct user and that this user has the necessary permissions.
